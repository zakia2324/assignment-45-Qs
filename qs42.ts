//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 40.
// Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the
// Great to each magicianâ€™s name.
//Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

//let magicianNames=["sana","faiza","zakia","hafsa"] ;

//function show_magicians(greet:string){
  //  for (let item of magicianNames){
//console.log(greet,item);
  //  }
//};
//show_magicians("hello hope you are fine!");

//show_magicians("you have to come at any cost");
