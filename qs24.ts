//More Conditional Tests: You don’t have to limit the number of tests you create to 10. If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests
//. Have at least one True and one False result for each of the following:
//• Tests for equality and inequality with strings

//• Tests using the lower case function

//• Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to

//• Tests using "and" and "or" operators

//• Test whether an item is in a array

//• Test whether an item is not in a array
